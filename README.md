## Introduction

Google Earth Engine is a tool for exploring and visualizing GIS data. The [API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/getstarted) provides a library and framework for running calculations on google servers. Code in this repository contains a mixture of server-side and client-side operations.

## slope-finder

This web app uses elevation and forest data to identify promising backcountry ski terrain. User input in the form of target slope angle, aspect, and tree coverage are used to generate map layers showcasing regions of interest. Users click on the map to generate a path of gradient descent and to visualize path statistics.
